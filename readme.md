This assignment was challenging to the right amount. Working with Beamlak Woldeab on it helped relieve the stress while enabling me learn significantly. It did!

I got confused when I tried writing the main test class using junit. Do you mid going over it with me sometime? That said, I included manual tests to the main method of SpellDictionary.java. This was because I didnt want to overwrite the junit tests, as I'd love to talk thorugh it with you.

Also, the end goal seemed far-reach initially--- reading and correcting words from a file??? It seemed like a lot. However, having implemented it, I feel happy as it strengthened my mindset of being able to do any assignment, regardless of how difficult it looks at first glance.

Thanks for this, Halie!!

Also, I needed the assignment break. It made me catch-up and refresh
